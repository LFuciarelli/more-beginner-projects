## Introduction
After creating a repository with [five beginner projects for someone learning Python]() during the COVID-19 quarantine, I decided to do more five projects. This time the projects ideas came from a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HHRWg--Ce4) of the channel Tech With Tim.

`Disclaimer:` I highly recommend you to try to solve these projects by yourself before looking at the solutions. Practice is very important in programming.
## Projects
### 1. Login system
Create a page where the person can create an account or login. In the first case, you ask them for an e-mail, a username, two passwords and store the information in a text file or database. In the second one, ask the person for a username and a password.

This [tutorial](https://realpython.com/openpyxl-excel-spreadsheets-python/#writing-excel-spreadsheets-with-openpyxl) from RealPython explains how to work with Excel spreadsheets using the package openpyxl.

### 4. Turtle module
Create a “turtle race” game. When the player hits space, the turtles start running and then keep track of which one won in a text file for scores.

**Sources**

I used the [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html) of the module to write the code, but you can also check out this [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7CiFhiTdvY&list=PLzMcBGfZo4-kfGgYZb9dwW3VhoBRG0h9c) from the channel Tech With Tim to learn how to use it.
